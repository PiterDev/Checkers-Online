# Checkers Online

This is a project I'm currently working on to learn web development.
Please note that I'm a beginner and you probably shouldn't follow the practices from my code nor learn from it (at least at this stage of the project). I don't know what I'm doing.

# Overview

I'm planning to create a website where you can start a live checkers game with another player.
Once the MVP is done I want to add more features like statistics or replays.
